# stdnum

The stdnum library in OCaml provides functions for handling, parsing, and validating standard numbers. It can be used for identifiers like PESEL, NIP, REGON, and international standards like ISBN or EAN. It offers conversion, information extraction, and validation, useful for systems like accounting, resource management, e-commerce, and more.
